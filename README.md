## Files
FaceDetect_01.pde is designed to capture faces from video that are identified by OpenCV and adds their coordinates to a .csv file

data.csv is the cumulative coordinates of Steve Buscemi's face throughout the movie The Big Lebowski

drawBuscemi.pde takes the coordinates collected in the data.csv and cuts out Steve Buscemi's face as the movie plays. 

## Example Clip
I will upload a full movie video when I get the time.
